# Rusoto chained Futures

Example of putting together Rusoto Futures and letting them run themselves, in order. This sample uses the local DynamoDB service, like [the Rusoto Custom Region example](https://github.com/matthewkmayer/matthewkmayer.github.io/tree/master/samples/rusoto-local-dynamodb) does.
