		<p>Looking back at 2024: Technical and Personal reflections.</p>
<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>
<p>Nothing stood out out as a must-have in 2024, but there are a few items to watch.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj">jujutsu</a>, also known as <code>jj</code>, is worth watching. It&rsquo;s source control management compatible with git. A simpler mental model than git, at least as powerful as git and can be used right now without anyone else knowing you&rsquo;re using it. This might be the next big shift, similar to how git took over from Subversion.</p>
<p><a href="https://ghostty.org/">ghostty</a> had its first public release at the end of 2024. I&rsquo;m test driving it to see if it&rsquo;ll tear me away from <a href="https://alacritty.org/">alacritty</a>, my current terminal of choice.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence is still &ldquo;almost there&rdquo; from my perspective. The biggest change is how it can replace search engines. Less &ldquo;let me Google that problem&rdquo; and more &ldquo;AI, how do I solve problem X?&rdquo; It won&rsquo;t get you directly to home base but you start on second or third base instead of picking up the baseball bat.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>My personal theme for 2024 was giving back. I used my money, my time and my expertise to help groups I&rsquo;m passionate about. In 2025 there will be more.</p>
<p>I kept up with motorcycling by riding the <a href="https://www.transamtrail.com/">Trans-America Trail</a>: coast to coast across the United States on mostly unpaved roads. It took about a month to do, including some setbacks and unplanned aventures but was an amazing trip.</p>
<h2 id="2025">2025</h2>
<p>More travel, more motorcycling. Drone stuff. Motorcycle stuff.</p>
