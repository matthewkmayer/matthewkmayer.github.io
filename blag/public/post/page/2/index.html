        <p>
            Ever hear someone say &ldquo;CI/CD build pipeline&rdquo; and weren't sure that that means, exactly?
Let's define and explore the concepts of:
 Build server Continuous Integration (CI) Continous Delivery (CD)  Three separate ideas Build server is a server, servers or a system that automatically builds and tests code.
Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery are both processes, guiding humans on what to do.
Build server (or build service) Whenever code is pushed to the repository, the build server checks out that commit or branch and tries to build the code and run tests.

        <p>
            After three years maintaining an open source project, it's time to take a few months of me time.
TL;DR I'm taking a break to do things I've been missing. I will be back, no later than September 1st, 2018.
Rusoto history and running an open source project Back in early 2015, Anthony DiMarco and I started Rusoto. Rust's promises of performance and correctness looked like a perfect match for cloud computing.

            Per the call for blog posts, I've got thoughts and ideas on where Rust can go in the upcoming year. My wants haven't changed much over the last year or so: give me non-embarassing compilation speed! üòÅ
Before getting started, I'm very appreciative of the hard work put into the overall Rust community and ecosystem, including the behind-the-scenes work. It's difficult to understate just how much time and energy people volunteer in pursuit of a better, Rust-ier world.

            Rusoto, an unofficial SDK for Amazon Web Services, had a wonderful year! We made great strides in improving functionality, increasing the number of services covered and making various ergonomic changes.
Improved functionality  Added all publicly available AWS regions Custom endpoint support HTTP connection pools for connecting to services S3 supports streaming responses: no more loading the entire file to download into a Vector  More supported services A non-exhaustive list:

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Test Driven Development (TDD) encourages better software design. When the desired behavior is known and expressible, it's highly effective to make modular and easily tested code.
Let's take a look at using TDD with Rust, using release-party as an example.
What we're changing Release-party is a command line tool I made for my day job. We've got a fair amount of repositories on GitHub: one for each microservice. Our deployments are automated through TravisCI: the master branch is deployed to our testing environment and the release branch is deployed to production.

            While a software enginerd/pixie wrangler at heart, I've discovered the stereotypical developer path of grabbing a ticket from Jira, working on it, shoving the results to QA and repeat isn't for me. The biggest reason is how this leaves a tremendous amount of efficiency on the table. This inefficient approach is difficult to reconcile with empathy for the customer buying and using the product.
My code writing speed has peaked: I can't write code any faster.

        <p>
            My recap of RustConf 2017 in Portland, Oregon. Or: how I avoided hotel surge pricing during the eclipse weekend!
RustConf the second I've been told the first conference for community or technology is the best. I'm happy to report I don't believe it applies in this case! The first RustConf set a tone of possibility and potentials whereas RustConf 2017 focused more on the progress made in the language, ecosystem and community.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            This is part three of Rusoto code generation. The first two parts went over how code inside a crate is generated. In this post, we'll take a look at how we make the crate for an AWS service.
Parts one and two recap In the previous two posts, we followed code generation from the Simple Queue Service (SQS) botocore service definition to Rust code. We glossed over where the generated code went in order to concentrate on the generation itself.

        <p>
            In the previous post we took a quick tour of the major pieces of Rusoto code generation. In this post we'll get deeper into code generation for the Simple Queue Service.
Picking up from part one Part one described a few parts of Rusoto codegen:
 Finding which services to generate Making the service's crate Generating the service and placing it inside its crate rustfmt the generated code to make it look pretty  Step three is where this post will concentrate.
