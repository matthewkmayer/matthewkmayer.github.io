		<p>Looking back at 2025: Technical and Personal reflections.</p>
<p>Starting out with how my <a href="https://matthewkmayer.github.io/blag/public/post/2024-in-review/">2024 reflections</a> looked:</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve doubled down on jj (jujutsu) as my version control system of choice. There&rsquo;s been perhaps a dozen times I&rsquo;ve used git directly in the past six months.</p>
<p>Ghostty&rsquo;s been my terminal of choice. Feels just how I want a terminal to work.</p>
<p>AI for search and finding info is certainly better but it&rsquo;s still best to check its sources to see what things it made up.</p>
<p>AI for coding can nail small, scoped tasks, especially if you know what the end result should look like. For larger tasks it gets out of hand in a hurry and the incredible time disparity of someone making a huge AI generated pull request, not reviewing it themselves, and asking others to do so, is a big and growing issue.</p>
<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>
<p>I toyed with a game engine to make a tower defense style game. It was fun to learn things and work inside a framework unlike what I&rsquo;m used to.</p>
<p>Not much has cropped up as something I&rsquo;m interested in, likely due to &ldquo;AI this&rdquo; and &ldquo;AI that&rdquo; taking center stage everywhere.</p>
<p>The only new-to-me thing that looks interesting is <a href="https://mergiraf.org/">Mergiraf</a>. It&rsquo;s been useful helping others sort out their self-inflicted git wounds.</p>
<h2 id="personal">Personal</h2>
<p>I continued to donate to local causes and started a monthly donation to the Ladybird browser project in March of 2025.</p>
<p>Taught a lot of motorcycle classes through the summer.</p>
<p>Read over 54 books in 2025, mostly for fun, some for education.</p>
<p>Motorcycled through France, Italy and Switzerland again.</p>
<p>Visited Hawaii&rsquo;s big island with family.</p>
<h2 id="2026">2026</h2>
<p>A refocus on physical fitness.</p>
<p>More writing.</p>
