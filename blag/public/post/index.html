        <p>
            This is my perspective of the current state of Rusoto as a semi-retired maintainer and Amazon outsider. The post borrows the term winter from AI Winter: a time period of decreased interest and funding.
Amazon is hiring engineers for an AWS Rust SDK Amazon has two public job openings for Senior Software Development Engineers - AWS Rust SDK. There&rsquo;s now enough customer demand for Amazon to make an official SDK for Rust.

        <p>
            Red/green bugfixes are the best technique for communicating understanding of a bug and its solution, especially for asynchronous code reviews.
A bug Say a new bug has been discovered in a backend service. If it&rsquo;s found in production, the first instinct is to solve it as quickly as possible. While laudable, this kneejerk reaction can actually make the fix slower and harder for others to understand.
Usual fixing procedure  Reproduce the bug Using logs and/or reading the code, find where the issue is Fix the bug, make a pull request, let coworkers review it  While this procedure is straightforward and can get a bug fix out quickly, there are downsides to this process:

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            TL;DR: I&rsquo;m not working on Rusoto any more.
A history of Rusoto Anthony DiMarco and I started Rusoto in July of 2015. I knew we started the project shortly after Rust&rsquo;s 1.0 release, but I didn&rsquo;t realize we had our first commit less than two months after Rust 1.0 landed. Wow!
Some early parts of Rusoto are similar to how Rusoto looks now, others are quite a bit different. Our first iteration of code generation used a Python2 script to parse the botocore service definitions and output Rust.

        <p>
            Per my tweet: doing Advent of Code 2019 the wrong way. üòÅ
Today we&rsquo;re easing into #serverless.
WHAT are we doing? Advent of Code!
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.
It&rsquo;s an excuse to play around with smaller coding problems and enjoy some recreational coding. In this series of blog posts, we&rsquo;re going to go about solving the problems the wrong way: as much serverless as possible.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Rust: a Language for the Next 40 Years put a seed of an idea on my head. I recommend watching the 55 minute video if you haven&rsquo;t had a chance yet.
The recent posts on the Microsoft Security Response Center blog helped the pieces click in my head.
Rust is like anti lock brakes (ABS) for motorcycles.
Wait, what? There are a lot of parallels here!
Bringing a motorcycle to a stop as quickly as possible is a skill.

        <p>
            Like last year I&rsquo;m taking a summer break from open source, including Rusoto.
Outside time is good for me I&rsquo;ll be spending more time outside and less time on a computer until September 2019. There won&rsquo;t be a disappearing act but I&rsquo;ll be significantly reducing the amount of time spent on computers for the next few months.
Until then!

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">How much testing is enough?</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            Most software developers will tell you that tests are good. More tests are better. How much is enough? How can one recognize diminishing returns? What types of tests should be written? Here are some guidelines for determining what a team&rsquo;s &ldquo;enough&rdquo; level of testing is.
Definitions and goals  unit test: tests a single unit of code. Think a single function or method. If there are more than one or three mocks being used, it&rsquo;s probably not a unit test functional test: tests behavior of code, staying within a single process integration test: a test that crosses a process boundary.

        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            A hot take on hot patching/fixing.
Definitions A hot patch, or hot fix, is a method of fixing a critical bug found in production by following a branching strategy that&rsquo;s outside the norm of software development. Specifically called out in Gitflow, this process is more complex and error prone than treating a critical bug as a regular bug or feature.
When following Gitflow, a hot patch can get a fix to production faster by making the change off the master branch, which is then also applied to the release branch.

        <h1 class="catalogue-title">Chaining Rusoto Futures</h1>
        <div class="catalogue-line"></div>

        <p>
            <p>Rusoto supports asynchronously running commands to AWS. While immediately making a blocking call to AWS is a common use case, one can create actions to run async and let the <code>tokio</code> runtime handle it. This opens up the ability to run multiple AWS calls concurrently.</p>
<p>If a project sets up infrastructure on AWS, the actions that don&rsquo;t depend on others to finish can run concurrently. For example: creating an S3 bucket and an SQS queue. Instead of creating a bucket and waiting for the request to finish, then moving on to creating the queue, one can put the Rusoto <code>Futures</code> together and concurrently run them.</p>
<p>In this post we&rsquo;ll explore to examples of using futures and the Rusoto DynamoDB client.</p>
