<p>Brace yourself for car analogies.</p>
<h3 id="vehicles-openclosed-loops">Vehicles: open/closed loops</h3>
<p>Modern cars have two modes of operation: open loop and closed loop.</p>
<p>Open loop: get engine inputs such as engine speed, air temperature and how much air is going into the engine. Apply a set of rules to determine how much fuel to put in.</p>
<p>Closed loop: using the above data <em>combined with information from the exhaust</em>, adjust how much fuel goes into the engine. Reading information from the engine&rsquo;s output lets the engine computer accurately determine how much fuel to supply.</p>
<h3 id="software-openclosed-loops">Software: open/closed loops</h3>
<p>Software can be thought of similarly.</p>
<p>Open loop: code up a feature or make a bug fix. Ship it, don&rsquo;t check the changes did what they are supposed to do.</p>
<p>Closed loop: same coding of a feature or bug fix, but <em>verify the new behavior works</em>.</p>
<p>Automating verification via tests can work but sometimes a manual check is sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="my-story-of-doing-it-wrong">My story of Doing It Wrong</h3>
<p>As a new hire in a previous job, I was in a hurry to prove myself. I took a bug that looked straightforward, made my fix and shipped it. My open loop approach skipped verification of the fix. The bug remained. Customers were unhappy and my professional ego took a blow.</p>
<p>This situation taught the importance of closed loop development. All future features or bug fixes involved doing the work and <em>verifying</em> the change worked.</p>
<h3 id="one-more-analogy">One more analogy</h3>
<p>Imagine your sink faucet is leaky. You call a plumber. They do some work, hand you a bill and leave. When you turn on the faucet, water sprays everywhere and the leak is still present. That&rsquo;s a bad look for the plumber - you immediately call their professionalism into question. The plumbing company gets a call back and they need to do the work again. Nobody is happy in this situation. Much time could be saved by the plumber testing their work before leaving.</p>
<h3 id="do-closed-loop-development">Do closed loop development</h3>
<p>Make changes. Test the changes. Verify it works. Be the employee that says the change is done and everyone <em>knows</em> it&rsquo;s true.</p>
