Like [last year](https://matthewkmayer.github.io/blag/public/post/2018-break/) I'm taking a summer break from open source, including Rusoto.

## Outside time is good for me

I'll be spending more time outside and less time on a computer until September 2019. There won't be a disappearing act but I'll be significantly reducing the amount of time spent on computers for the next few months.

Until then!
