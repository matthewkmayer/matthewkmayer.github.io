After three years maintaining an open source project, it's time to take a few months of me time.

## TL;DR

I'm taking a break to do things I've been missing. I *will* be back, no later than September 1st, 2018.

## Rusoto history and running an open source project

Back in early 2015, Anthony DiMarco and I started [Rusoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto). Rust's promises of performance and correctness looked like a perfect match for cloud computing. Our employer at the time was an expert AWS consulting business and we knew an SDK for AWS would be required before it could take off in the cloud. So we made it.

I've learned a tremendous amount in three years of open source maintainership. One thing I've learned is I am susceptible to spending all my time working on it, to the detriment of other hobbies and activities I enjoy.

Another thing I've learned is it's immensely frustrating when a maintainer goes silent. It's understandable and more common than one would think. I'd like to avoid it, so here's a note saying *why* I'm taking a break and that I *will* be back.

There are six people with maintainer rights to Rusoto. It will keep moving forward and I'm excited to see where it will be when I get back to it.

## What I'll be doing

I'm going to spend more time riding my motorcycles. More camping trips with my wife, more visiting family. 

I'm also going to level up my metalworking skills and get my 1971 Plymouth Duster roadworthy again. Coding is fun but sometimes you have to roll your sleeves up and get your hands dirty in the literal sense.

Contributors, users, friends: thank you for your support. Here's to another three years of Rusoto. ðŸ™‚
