Looking back at 2025: Technical and Personal reflections.

<!--more-->

Starting out with how my [2024 reflections](https://matthewkmayer.github.io/blag/public/post/2024-in-review/) looked:

I've doubled down on jj (jujutsu) as my version control system of choice. There's been perhaps a dozen times I've used git directly in the past six months.

Ghostty's been my terminal of choice. Feels just how I want a terminal to work.

AI for search and finding info is certainly better but it's still best to check its sources to see what things it made up.

AI for coding can nail small, scoped tasks, especially if you know what the end result should look like. For larger tasks it gets out of hand in a hurry and the incredible time disparity of someone making a huge AI generated pull request, not reviewing it themselves, and asking others to do so, is a big and growing issue.

## Technical

I toyed with a game engine to make a tower defense style game. It was fun to learn things and work inside a framework unlike what I'm used to.

Not much has cropped up as something I'm interested in, likely due to "AI this" and "AI that" taking center stage everywhere.

The only new-to-me thing that looks interesting is [Mergiraf](https://mergiraf.org/). It's been useful helping others sort out their self-inflicted git wounds.

## Personal

I continued to donate to local causes and started a monthly donation to the Ladybird browser project in March of 2025.

Taught a lot of motorcycle classes through the summer.

Read over 54 books in 2025, mostly for fun, some for education.

Motorcycled through France, Italy and Switzerland again.

Visited Hawaii's big island with family.

## 2026

A refocus on physical fitness.

More writing.
