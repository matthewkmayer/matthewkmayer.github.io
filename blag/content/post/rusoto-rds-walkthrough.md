Let's tie some great Rust crates together!  In this walkthrough, we'll use [Rusoto](https://github.com/rusoto/rusoto) to create a Postgres RDS database instance,
[Rocket.rs](https://github.com/SergioBenitez/Rocket) to make a web server and [Diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel) to talk to the database on AWS to make a proof of concept hit counter.

## Prerequisites

### Rocket

Starting with the Rocket web site, we'll need to use Rust nightly.  This walkthrough uses `rustc 1.18.0-nightly (036983201 2017-04-26)`.  To switch to that nightly release, run `rustup default nightly-2017-04-26`.  The output of that command should look like this:

```bash
info: syncing channel updates for 'nightly-2017-04-26-x86_64-apple-darwin'
info: downloading component 'rustc'
 42.3 MiB /  42.3 MiB (100 %) 1014.4 KiB/s ETA:   0 s                
info: downloading component 'rust-std'
 58.2 MiB /  58.2 MiB (100 %)   1.4 MiB/s ETA:   0 s                
info: downloading component 'cargo'
  3.6 MiB /   3.6 MiB (100 %)   1.1 MiB/s ETA:   0 s                
info: downloading component 'rust-docs'
 11.5 MiB /  11.5 MiB (100 %)   1.1 MiB/s ETA:   0 s                
info: installing component 'rustc'
info: installing component 'rust-std'
info: installing component 'cargo'
info: installing component 'rust-docs'
info: default toolchain set to 'nightly-2017-04-26-x86_64-apple-darwin'

  nightly-2017-04-26-x86_64-apple-darwin installed - rustc 1.18.0-nightly (2b4c91158 2017-04-25)
```

Verify `rustc` is using the right version:

```bash
$ rustc --version
rustc 1.18.0-nightly (2b4c91158 2017-04-25)
```

### Diesel

To set up Diesel, we'll need to [install Postgres](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides) to get the required libraries for Diesel CLI.  The Postgres service doesn't have to be running for this walkthrough.

Then install the Diesel CLI tool with the Postgres extensions: `cargo install diesel_cli --features "postgres" --no-default-features`.

### Rusoto

For the AWS portions of this walkthrough, ensure AWS access keys are available either in environment variables or AWS credentials file.

## Rocket site

Follows the guide at https://rocket.rs/ .  Rocket is why nightly Rust is required: Rusoto and Diesel work on stable Rust.

## Creating a Postgres RDS instance

See [rusoto-rds/src/main.rs](rusoto-rds/src/main.rs) for the full code.

In the `rusoto-rds` directory, run `cargo run` to create a new database and wait for it to be available.
Once the endpoint is available, put that in the `.env` file in `rusoto-rocket`.

Example:

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://masteruser:TotallySecurePassword501@localhost/rusoto_rocket`

The code will:

* Create a new database
* Wait for it to be created
* Extract the endpoint to use with Diesel

## Security groups
Using the AWS Console, add a new rule to the security group the RDS instance is using.  Allow inbound traffic on port 5432
from your IP address.

## Diesel basics
Install with `cargo install diesel_cli --features "postgres" --no-default-features`.

Set up `.env` to have the connection string from the new RDS instance, including username and password:

`DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:TotallySecurePassword501@localhost/rusoto_rocket`

The up and down files have been populated in this sample.

Up file:
```SQL
CREATE TABLE hits (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    hits_so_far SERIAL NOT NULL
)
```

Down file:
```SQL
DROP TABLE hits
```

In the `rusoto-rocket` directory, run `diesel setup`.  This will connect to RDS and create the database with the required schema.

If the command times out, ensure your security groups allow inbound access from your IP address.

## Connecting it all

Run `cargo run` in `rusoto-rocket` directory.  This will spin up a Rocket webserver on http://localhost:8000.
Visit that page to see the hit counter.  Refresh the page and see it increment by one for every page visit.
The data is stored in the RDS instance on AWS. ðŸŽ‰

## Cleaning up

To ensure the database doesn't keep running and potentially run up AWS bills, log in to the AWS Console and delete the
RDS DB instance.

## Demo vs longer term infrastructure

* Use Cloudformation via Troposphere.
* Deploy via CodeDeploy, ElasticBeanstalk, Elastic Container Service instead of SCP.

Testing notes:
`docker run --name postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:alpine`
